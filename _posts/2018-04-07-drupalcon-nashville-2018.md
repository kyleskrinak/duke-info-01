I will be leading two sessions at the [DrupalCon Higher Education Summit](https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/higher-ed-summit) on Monday, April 8th, 2018, and I&rsquo;m using this post for my preparation notes.

**Note:** these agenda items are not hard-and-fast discussion items. Depending on session attendees and details I cannot anticipate, these discussions tend to grow a life of their own. I find that nearly always, the actual discussion turns out far better than I anticipate. *Caveat lector.*

## Session 1; 11:20 AM &ndash; 12:20 PM
### Continuous Integration / Continuous Development Strategies

#### Agenda

* **Spread out and speak up**
* **Volunteers for note-keeping**  
*(Google docs allows for multiple authors. The more the merrier)*
* **Introductions**   
Tell us your name, title, what you do, and your efforts at CI/CD so far?
* **What are the tools of CI/CD?** What are you using?  
At Duke's Trinity School of Arts &amp; Sciences, we're using [gitlab-ci](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/). We have used Jenkins, we still have a 2-year old Jenkins server, but we prefer gitlab-ci.
* How long have you been using CI/CD?
* What benefits have you seen because of your adoption?  
How would you like to extend your CI/CD adoption?
* What are some blockers or obstacles to implementation?
* Examples or potential CI/CD workflows
* Examples of shared CI/CD resources

## Session 2; 1:30 AM &ndash; 2:30 PM
### Web Accessibility, led by Joel Crawford-Smith

Led by my fellow Dukie, [Joel,](http://joelcrawfordsmith.com/) with whom we collaborate frequently. Looking forward to his session.
